# Changelog

## Unreleased

First working version. Not released yet.

- Read a model and describe it without any ORM detail, so another ORM can be supported later.
- Fields that display, edit and convert values, chosen from the column types.
- One async interface over async and sync SQLAlchemy sessions.
- List pages with search across dotted paths, filters with counts, sorting and paging, and no
  N+1 queries.
- Filters you can write yourself.
- Create, edit, detail and delete pages, with links picked from a list or searched.
- Permissions at view, action, field and row level.
- Hooks that run inside the transaction and can refuse a save.
- Bulk actions over the chosen rows or over every row matching the filter.
- CSV export of the filtered list.
- Signing in, and a CSRF token on every form.
